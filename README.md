# Gilded Rose Automated Refactoring Kata

This Kata is the Java version taken from Emily Bache's repository: https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

A [golden master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization_test) was added using [Approval Tests](https://approvaltests.com/).

## How to use this Kata

The goal of this kata is to refactor the code ONLY using automated refactoring moves from your IDE.
Write down the list of automated refactoring you perform, to build a dictionary of refactoring moves.

If at some point you feel that you cannot use an automated refactoring, you are allowed to do an operation manually. Just write it down.

At the end of the session, share with others the refactoring moves you used, and discuss the manual operations you had to perform (if any).
